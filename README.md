The-Space-Cabbages
==================

The Space Cabbages is the NAZA Space APP competition to solve the challenge DEPLOYABLE GREENHOUSE. Our ground breaking idea includes resource management and recent technologies in agriculture, engineering and space science. We believe that our project, however conceptual, is feasible and can be developed to initiate and sustain human colonies in outer space environments.
